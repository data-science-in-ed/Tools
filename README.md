# Software

In EDCT-GE 2550 we will be using several online services and software packages to set up a learning analytics system (see the image [learning_analytics_diamond.png](https://github.com/data-science-in-ed/Tools/blob/master/learning_analytics_diamond.png) in this repository for more information). In order to both particpate in the class and collect data from the class all students will need to have operational, up-to-date accounts and installations of these tools.

### You will need to make accounts with the following services.

## [Twitter](www.twitter.com)

Twitter will be used to:
  * Ask questions about the course
  * Comment on readings
  * In class communication (backchannel) including notifying when a student is not following content:
    * For example, if instructions are unclear or the lecture is difficult to follow tweet #DSE16 #IDKWGO

**All tweets need to be tagged with the hashtag #DSE16** 

Be a good Twitizen, check out this [etiquette guide](http://mashable.com/2013/10/14/twitter-etiquette/) for engaging on Twitter.

## [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 

Instructions for setup can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) and [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
